These words are for each and every good ol' boy in this land.

These words are for those two boys that bumped passed me to get to the train. They love the trains. They love the trains so much. Grandpa taught them everything about the trains and grandpa was so happy about the passion those brothers lived with. These words are for the girls that love stationary. They love stationary so much. Some of these girls are so passionate about what they like to do that my heart breaks when I think about the post office. Those boys like the trains so much that it breaks my heart when I think about engineering.

Please think about those boys when studying American history. Please think about those girls when studying American history. That is our culture. Our culture is not the words we read in books or the accusations we read in the headlines. The culture of American civilization is written on the tablet of our hearts that we take with us to the grave. If America can remember this when lead into temptation, the tablet of your heart will deliver you from the evil one.
