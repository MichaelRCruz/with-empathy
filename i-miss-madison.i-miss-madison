When I was still in Los Angeles I used to dream about coming back. I wanted
to write an email to some one. I think I even told Brendan about it. I was
ready to be some kind of mentor. That is why I returned. It was like the
default thing to do when you fail after college. Remember that movie, Old
School?

In my email was supposed to be three friends that went to school together.
The days we were still friends I texted Erik, in excitement, that we could
change the world. I think I even said something about effecting the Trump
election.

Madison, I was that confident, but maybe this is a better time for the two
of us to be in love again.
