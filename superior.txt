No one may withstand the tastes of man.

There is no escape from glamor.

Art rules the world.

Music is art.

I have superior taste in music.

I am a servant of God and believe these words to be the fat portions of
my flock.

Coin will only work if you have pay phones. My warning to you is that if
you wait too long, the lines already laid will be difficult to have. Your
city wants the old school ones. You want grandma's phone number. You have
to hold on to that number. You have to hold on to the telephone company in
your small town. In the spirit of transparency, I do not know much about
phone companies. I am sure it is complicated now, but it never used to be.
That is what you are looking for, kids. You want those phone booths again.
You want _all_ of them back though. For example, in Chicago, you can see
the rust on the concrete where a bunch of them were at the base of Trump
tower. The payphones are just the start, celebrities.

You need a city, like Chicago, that can promote the use of the old card
machines. This is the only way to beat the fucking banks. You will not be
able to shed the dependency on credit and debit for a while so you need to
eat hot dogs for a while, figuratively. In other words, the merchants must
all eventually find their way into business this way. You all need to start
using the credit card machines again. I mean the swiping ones. Your kids,
or the kids themselves, need to find a way to make them appealing culturally.
We just have to make them fashionable for a while until we get rid of them.
It is all about getting off their network.

This document should find what we are looking for with this "coin" thing
that I fucking made up, just saying. I do not even have to bitch about
any bullshit to show you how to bust out of the Dollar. I do not even have
to teach you about currency. In fact, this will be a learning experience
and after reading this you will know enough to be dangerous.

. . .


After reading this, you might find out this has already been
done in some society in history. I am surprised that the stories of this
fabled society are never remembered. Enoch might have had something like
Coin, but Enoch did not have "dongles" in their money like we do in our
money and our computers. Some one discovered that money had a
component-like structure to it similar to my ideas about the mother
fucking base, i.e., 1/2.

People, I hope, understand how inconvenient it was when you did not have
a dime to _place a call_. It is weird because you can jack some one. You
can fuck up a lot of shit with that stupid fucking dime. Men went bananas
with that fucking dime. Think of the concept applied to other things. Some
knucklehead went bonkers with all the shit learned from that fucking dime.
That is all I want to say about that because it is true and because that
allows all of you to examine for yourselves this bloody device.

Your governors will suggest returning the call back to twenty-five cents,
but if we do and then when we die, our kids will find the dime dildo in
a closet somewhere. That is not what we are going to do. We are going to
learn from this the correct way.

We are going to use a phone coin to control our currency. No matter what
year it is, the cost of reaching a loved one is going to be the same
because the bad guys love their family as much as the good guys love their
family. This means that, today, a phone call is worth between twenty-five
and thirty-five cents. When we decide, then we lock in the numbers we write
on the tags we hang from the antiques we sell from the houses we restore
on the land we were given by some one else.

Do I make myself clear?

The phone call is how we describe the cost of the energy we need to say
the time we departed to our destination from our origin. The cost of a
phone call is like most important measurement of a jacket. Without naming
the most important measurement of a jacket, despite us all knowing there
is one to name, will help you see how the quarter-dollar is centralized
in some way.

When the dust settles, every one is going to ask how we get there. First,
I would have to defend that thing that resembles the gold standard. How
genius is this? We have something that we pay for that should never be
more difficult for our children to pay for. A phone call is the most
appropriate solution for where to start.

This goes further because you will have to find the _only_ solution to
preserving this cost of a phone call. I do not care what any economist
says. The phone-call coin, similar to a quarter, is the best option for
preserving this thing. You can do so much with this fucking coin and it
would look so sexy in your city. I mean, your payphones are just popping
out of that blouse. I can hear them ringing at night in downtown Chicago.

Do you know how many people would want to visit Chicago if they suddenly
had pay-phones and sliding credit card machines?

Dudes, the dime hustle was a fucking buster. That leaves that.

. . .

You need something to make the phone calls. I would just set up the pay
phones again and give them back to the gangsters. That network will give
you a network for calls, but also a way to practice whatever you guys do.
You are home free and ready coining when you all feel safe with your
transactions. What I know is that the electronic card readers are on two
different networks, at least. You all are familiar with dial-up and any
other alternative that was _faster_. There are going to be some merchants
that use dial-up and just do not care, but my suspicion is that some
merchants take advantage of these dueling pianos. You need to break out
of their network and onto your own by any means necessary.

BNSF is clutch if you are thinking bigger than Chicago. I do not care
what anyone else says. The trains are so fucking important right now and
they need to be aware of this. My generation does not use the trains. They
just kept rolling along. Amtrak somehow is still here, but BNSF will always
be if all the farmers want them to be. The trains are your last defense.
The military probably does not realize this. The military has some dusty
manual on what to do, but throw it on the ground. America, we can trust
our military, but they need to declare a code freeze. Please tell them
about the network stuff. As upset as I want to be, and as correct as I am
in my anger, it still is anger. Tell the good ol' boys that if I could
stand guard for one thing, then that is BNSF Railway.

There is a thought process to this and an action process. The thought
process is going to be slow, but the action process is up to you. There
is no way to know how much torque that will create in society. How grumpy
will people be in the morning with this agenda? In other words turbulence
is bad like when the cannabis market got fucked with during some
perceivable roll-out. In other words, maybe that is a lesson for us. Maybe
time got us there. None of us want to be selling processed cannabis to
our neighborhoods. We do because the government has slowed us down enough
to surgically remove the dongles of our laptop. A charger here, an HDMI
cable there, and before we know it, the kids are selling CBD as if it is
cannabis and the police were arresting them for both.

You need an industry to use your Coin. Stick it to them, i.e., do the
right thing, and use the marijuana industry. California is your friend.
Work it out. Is it affordable to ship westward? For myself, I would set
up shop in Illinois. I would grow hydroponics in one of those skyscrapers
downtown and run shit. We would have the rivers. We would have the bridges.
We would have the water.

Besides the obvious, is when we cultivate correctly. Fuck ethics. If we all
use the tools for what they are made for, then California can continue to
grow the cannabis we cannot dream of. If we try to be like them, fail, we
still have their back. In other words, if we read the documentation grow
our cannabis and also oil our trucks, then our boats can get all their shit
to the east coast and beyond.

You men must embrace the fact that there is no way this will happen without
hands, but further the phones need hands to maintain them and booby trap them.
There is no way the federal government can get hands all over them pay phones.
You have to set them up though. Once your men are comfortable with their set
ups, then you basically home free to be optimistic.

Since this is true, the neighborhoods begin to resemble the neighborhoods built
by the Mafia. If this is not your preferred society, then you do not understand
the Mafia. A little bird told me that the Mafia is there for when the
governments fail, but we can say that a little more romantically. This way we
can also talk about the restaurants.

If every one can see the family restaurant and the other one down the street and
the high school their children goes to and where their kids work when they do,
then it is a peaceful scene. I like to think about it because, for myself, I still
consider that way of life a preference. In other words, there are many ways to
live, but I love this one so much in ways that make me feel good because of my
neighbor because I can be better than him. That man feels the same.

We need to decide what this is, but to our fortune, we need to decide. The phone
coin is something I would sail. The standard cost of the most standard good is
a nexus in currency.

Criminal Pope conviction likely-style dangerous if and only if the Phone Coin
assumes the wrong name space. In other words, the first rule of the Phone Coin
is that the coin itself will always be called a Phone Coin.

The next step is awesome, but maintaining that coin, its name space, and all
the hardware that works with he coin is impossible if that fucking dime shows
up again. The fact that we are learning how terrifying the devices of the dimes
were for us says we are doing something correctly, righteously, and carefully.
This pace and approach is the shit I do like.

If you can see how the cost of a phone call locks in the cost set for all the
food you buy, then you understand what academia understands. They understand
that this would fix inflation, curb fiscal spending, expose the social security
bullshit, basically all the money things. This lock on the costs of goods works
in theory. Let us figure how to put this into real life.

Imagine there is a special coin that we minted that only works for the pay phones.
Think through how much that could help or harm your neighborhood because I do not
know all of them. Please do not make the mistake of telling your boss how it is
going. Try not to let any excitement clog up the lines communication with you and
your boss. The neighborhoods will feel different for a little while, but my dudes
have to really watch out for propaganda, but I do not know all of them. Here are
some examples.

Call me on this pay phone, but you got a flat tire, and missed the call but like
the new-school kind of bang-bangs. If you can run a pay-phone, then other men
cannot take it from you, but they can muddy the waters so you cannot drink. The
hustles they have in corporate America are fierce, but you should prepare for
the window of time they spend adjusting to your streets with their shit. In other
words I will have to get back to you on all the things I can think of when I have
time for that topic. Before moving on, I just want to say that the term,
propaganda, feels insufficient for any of this. I mean, it is there, but it is
probably a combination of crime and propaganda. Some artist probably has written
about that thing I cannot think of.

Picture yourself on the street in this new theater. Do not get discouraged about
all that does not work because some of it will still work, but some will not.
Maybe this is what it is like busting out of grandpa's garage with a mini gun and
dust is flying everywhere, then it jams. This is basically what is going on except
grandpa is in jail. You have to get him out.

Somewhere along this quest is a key. It will be something grandpa forgot about.
It will not be the main solution, but we do not want to beat the game without
completing this mission. That is what I do not want you to forget because the
option to not break grandpa out of jail is there not for a reason, but because
one day we are not supposed to. That could have already happened. Please do not
ever forget about that kind of thinking. If you lose that, then we are toast.

Moving on to something more tangible is how to understand credit and how or
if we want to phase that out. It seems comfortable jumping to this next topic
so that we have something to hang on to when exploring a life with no cash.
Let us build up to that. If we have been vigilant, then we have a network that
the credit cards can live on. The transactions by mechanical card readers are
worth visiting at this point. Think about how merchants operate and you will
see how far they will carry the mechanical card readers. My first concern would
be for the merchants on your block, as in, there are merchants everywhere and
we are not everywhere. Remembering this will help smokey the bear prevent many
forest fires.

Do not leave your market. You have a pay phone and a phone number, but we are
building an airplane in the sky, so-to-speak. Expect everything rolling downhill
to resemble something of a pattern. For example, I never want you to change your
phone number. For example, I prefer shorter name spaces rather than neglecting
_best practices_. If your boss can teach you these his way, then we are good to
go. That is how best practices are. You are not sure at first why the broom is
leaning against that counter, in your path, but you do not touch it. Try to
resist the urge to ask why it is there. Assume that your boss is a master jedi
ninja. When you get to that point, and can ignore the broom, again and again,
then you will be ready to understand that your boss talks to other bosses in
ways you never thought of. In other words, I really like best practices. Your
boss has figured out what they are with other bosses and sometimes one boss
figures out a better way. When this happens, the other bosses take that into
account until it is completely discussed and through all questioning. This
effort brings a new standard to the table whereby professionals decide if
they want to include the new _best practice_ into how they do things. That is
kind of how it works in software.

. . .

Look at the back of a quarter dollar.
