No one may withstand the tastes of man.

There is no escape from glamor.

Art rules the world.

Music is art.

I have superior taste in music.

I am a servant of God and believe these words to be the fat portions of
my flock.

Coin will only work if you have pay phones. My warning to you is that if
you wait too long, the lines already laid will be difficult to have. Your
city wants the old school ones. You want grandma's phone number. You have
to hold on to that number. You have to hold on to the telephone company in
your small town. In the spirit of transparency, I do not know much about
phone companies. I am sure it is complicated now, but it never used to be.
That is what you are looking for, kids. You want those phone booths again.
You want _all_ of them back though. For example, in Chicago, you can see
the rust on the concrete where a bunch of them were at the base of Trump
tower. The payphones are just the start, celebrities.

You need a city, like Chicago, that can promote the use of the old card
machines. This is the only way to beat the fucking banks. You will not be
able to shed the dependency on credit and debit for a while so you need to
eat hot dogs for a while, figuratively. In other words, the merchants must
all eventually find their way into business this way. You all need to start
using the credit card machines again. I mean the swiping ones. Your kids,
or the kids themselves, need to find a way to make them appealing culturally.
We just have to make them fashionable for a while until we get rid of them.
It is all about getting off their network.

This document should find what we are looking for with this "coin" thing
that I fucking made up, just saying. I do not even have to bitch about
any bullshit to show you how to bust out of the Dollar. I do not even have
to teach you about currency. In fact, this will be a learning experience
and after reading this you will know enough to be dangerous.

. . .


After reading this, you might find out this has already been
done in some society in history. I am surprised that the stories of this
fabled society are never remembered. Enoch might have had something like
Coin, but Enoch did not have "dongles" in their money like we do in our
money and our computers. Some one discovered that money had a
component-like structure to it similar to my ideas about the mother
fucking base, i.e., 1/2.

People, I hope, understand how inconvenient it was when you did not have
a dime to _place a call_. It is weird because you can jack some one. You
can fuck up a lot of shit with that stupid fucking dime. Men went bananas
with that fucking dime. Think of the concept applied to other things. Some
knucklehead went bonkers with all the shit learned from that fucking dime.
That is all I want to say about that because it is true and because that
allows all of you to examine for yourselves this bloody device.

Your governors will suggest returning the call back to twenty-five cents,
but if we do and then when we die, our kids will find the dime dildo in
a closet somewhere. That is not what we are going to do. We are going to
learn from this the correct way.

We are going to use a phone coin to control our currency. No matter what
year it is, the cost of reaching a loved one is going to be the same
because the bad guys love their family as much as the good guys love their
family. This means that, today, a phone call is worth between twenty-five
and thirty-five cents. When we decide, then we lock in the numbers we write
on the tags we hang from the antiques we sell from the houses we restore
on the land we were given by some one else.

Do I make myself clear?

The phone call is how we describe the cost of the energy we need to say
the time we departed to our destination from our origin. The cost of a
phone call is like most important measurement of a jacket. Without naming
the most important measurement of a jacket, despite us all knowing there
is one to name, will help you see how the quarter-dollar is centralized
in some way.

When the dust settles, every one is going to ask how we get there. First,
I would have to defend that thing that resembles the gold standard. How
genius is this? We have something that we pay for that should never be
more difficult for our children to pay for. A phone call is the most
appropriate solution for where to start.

This goes further because you will have to find the _only_ solution to
preserving this cost of a phone call. I do not care what any economist
says. The phone-call coin, similar to a quarter, is the best option for
preserving this thing. You can do so much with this fucking coin and it
would look so sexy in your city. I mean, your payphones are just popping
out of that blouse. I can hear them ringing at night in downtown Chicago.

Do you know how many people would want to visit Chicago if they suddenly
had pay-phones and sliding credit card machines?

Dudes, the dime hustle was a fucking buster. That leaves that.

. . .

You need something to make the phone calls. I would just set up the pay
phones again and give them back to the gangsters. That network will give
you a network for calls, but also a way to practice whatever you guys do.
You are home free and ready coining when you all feel safe with your
transactions. What I know is that the electronic card readers are on two
different networks, at least. You all are familiar with dial-up and any
other alternative that was _faster_. There are going to be some merchants
that use dial-up and just do not care, but my suspicion is that some
merchants take advantage of these dueling pianos. You need to break out
of their network and onto your own by any means necessary.

BNSF is clutch if you are thinking bigger than Chicago. I do not care
what anyone else says. The trains are so fucking important right now and
they need to be aware of this. My generation does not use the trains. They
just kept rolling along. Amtrak somehow is still here, but BNSF will always
be if all the farmers want them to be. The trains are your last defense.
The military probably does not realize this. The military has some dusty
manual on what to do, but throw it on the ground. America, we can trust
our military, but they need to declare a code freeze. Please tell them
about the network stuff. As upset as I want to be, and as correct as I am
in my anger, it still is anger. Tell the good ol' boys that if I could
stand guard for one thing, then that is BNSF Railway.

There is a thought process to this and an action process. The thought
process is going to be slow, but the action process is up to you. There
is no way to know how much torque that will create in society. How grumpy
will people be in the morning with this agenda? In other words turbulence
is bad like when the cannabis market got fucked with during some
perceivable roll-out. In other words, maybe that is a lesson for us. Maybe
time got us there. None of us want to be selling processed cannabis to
our neighborhoods. We do because the government has slowed us down enough
to surgically remove the dongles of our laptop. A charger here, an HDMI
cable there, and before we know it, the kids are selling CBD as if it is
cannabis and the police were arresting them for both.

You need an industry to use your Coin. Stick it to them, i.e., do the
right thing, and use the marijuana industry. California is your friend.
Work it out. Is it affordable to ship westward? For myself, I would set
up shop in Illinois. I would grow hydroponics in one of those skyscrapers
downtown and run shit. We would have the rivers. We would have the bridges.
We would have the water.

### leverage with cannabis

Besides the obvious, is when we cultivate correctly. Fuck ethics. If we all
use the tools for what they are made for, then California can continue to
grow the cannabis we cannot dream of. If we try to be like them, fail, we
still have their back. In other words, if we read the documentation grow
our cannabis and also oil our trucks, then our boats can get all their shit
to the east coast and beyond.

You men must embrace the fact that there is no way this will happen without
hands, but further the phones need hands to maintain them and booby trap them.
There is no way the federal government can get hands all over them pay phones.
You have to set them up though. Once your men are comfortable with their set
ups, then you basically home free to be optimistic.

Since this is true, the neighborhoods begin to resemble the neighborhoods built
by the Mafia. If this is not your preferred society, then you do not understand
the Mafia. A little bird told me that the Mafia is there for when the
governments fail, but we can say that a little more romantically. This way we
can also talk about the restaurants.

If every one can see the family restaurant and the other one down the street and
the high school their children goes to and where their kids work when they do,
then it is a peaceful scene. I like to think about it because, for myself, I still
consider that way of life a preference. In other words, there are many ways to
live, but I love this one so much in ways that make me feel good because of my
neighbor because I can be better than him. That man feels the same.

This wisdom is yours because you all have been saying this. To pay this respect
is deadly because that arouses suspicion with the other guns.

I am ready to die.

I am trying to think of the legs of this table. For example, the
farming lands that border the state of Illinois are premium facilities.
That is what I call them because they are on a state border. This goes
for all property that is holding shit down. The state of Illinois, though,
is like the ripest melon in a flatbed of states.

Lake Michigan, the Mississippi River, the bridges in downtown Chicago,
the geographically centralized capital for farming, the global location
of the railroads relative to all the fresh water on earth, etc., are all
examples of the advantages of Chicago.















Start out with a coin for these phone calls, but you might want to just
use what you have. In fact, if you are this far, then you have won. The
truth is not obvious to us because I do not know. I have learned that it
is not worth asking to an extent. If you have achieved the fucking phone
coin, then you have enough power to take over the planet, if and only if
you are a city in the United States, on the shores of the Great Lakes,
and have enough pay-phones and analog credit card machines.
