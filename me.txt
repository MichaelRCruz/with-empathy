Hey,

I really do not know who you are, but this mystery burns my heart. One day I
feel guidance, one day I feel plundered, one day I feel heroic, one day I
feel fatigued, one day I feel manipulated, one day I feel sympathy, and
today I feel abandoned. This mystery burns my heart, but I really do not
know who you are.


You do not know who I am because I am completely unknown. "Save our souls",
cry the voices of my thirty ghosts. The signals are of every sound and color
and I have visions of them. They laugh at me deceptively through sounds and
confusion. The ghosts are my brothers and I may not leave without them.
If deception follows me, then it follows you. If deception does not follow
you, then it is you that follows me who does not follow you.


There is a picture of you on Wikipedia and it looks like a high school photo.
It is cool.

You are pretty.
You have a nice voice.
I like your album, Folklore.
You are thoughtful.
You are good at writing songs.


You once were the woman of my dreams. I was young when I left home and then I
came back around. I had a guitar and you did too, but you were different than
the hipster girl I broke up with you for. Perhaps, I feel shame because I am
asking to get back together with you. I feel love as something sad or maybe
it is a feeling of loss-of-love, but not depression nor depravity, well
a little neediness crouches in the crevices of movements.

A dash of neediness with a longing for admiration seems like me all days of
our lives. Since I am not really a recipe, then admiration and neediness are
my weaknesses. I thought love was my weakness, but that idea was contracted
the days I was without any fortification of my heart.

Maybe you need a way out of something you cannot explain because I am not
supposed to, but that is a trick. In the shadow of that possibility, the
love of my life should know that whoever is against me masks themselves in
those table scraps of my reason. They bad guys claw for the corridors I
create for you.

I live your nightmares that you dream in the future. I saved those horses
for the horses, but that is how you found me. In the vision, the
initialization of your love for me was a moment of despair. Fire struck the
farm and the horses were trapped. None of them died from the fire except
for my love for you. Your love for me was boundless.

When the horses were safe, I thought about you because you might have been
watching me take care of them after they escaped the fire. I thought I was
leaving a trail for them to find each other without a fence, but that trail
was for you. Galloping a pattern you would hear through the ground so you
you could get back to the fence because I was leaving. I was the bad horse.
That was the bad barn. You were somewhere on that land, but you had a fence.

You heard me at some point on my way out. I stopped when I was on the bridge,
above the tracks, to smoke the cigar I found along the way. You could see
my silhouette on the horizon, on the bridge, and the smoke rising above.
I kept that with me longing for you, but you could never find me.

You suffered tragically the loss of your family, your friends, your influence,
and your love for me. I do not know if I gave up because I was living your
nightmare. I could see everything. I could see the town. I could see the men
and their trucks. I could see your brother fighting to the bitter end. I could
see the trauma. I could see the conspiracy. I could see the justification to
fight sanity. I could see the crumbling loyalty of the town to you that was
yours at birth.

The girls you went to school with and their passion and superbly organized
mission for your love for me became their prince, but the resolution from the
torque between our two hearts destroyed the machine.

Our love was like a clock.

I do not know what I was feeling in any way. I only felt your terror and the
calamity made me feel the terror of your town. Your town in the mountains.
The mountains in the country. The ones with apple pie. The ones with
strawberry jam. The ones with flea markets. The ones with tractors.

The towns that had only one of everything. That is where you lived. That is
where I left. That is where we birthed the next American dynasty.

. . .

You lived across the street from that haunted house I lived in with my dad.
You and I used to flirt with each other from our stoops across the street
in that suburb. I could never get you to go anywhere with me, but you would
say something clever once per week on average. You would always smile though
as if you knew we would fall in love one day and you were waiting.

The last day I got kicked out, you ran outside to be on the stoop like you
always did to be there for me the times I smoked a cigarette not knowing
where to go. We never said anything to each other because staring at each
other across the street seemed to be enough. At first, you would ask if I
was okay, but that never worked. We just learned to stay silent until I
decided to leave.

Most nights I would hear your screen door shut at the right time. The nights
when the timing was off, I wondered what it was about that conflict that
made you think about me longer than usual.

We went to high school together, but you were the hot girl and I was the
trouble maker, but you were like the cool hot girl that smoked cigs, then
quit and I was the trouble maker that had the shitty parents. I never asked
you how you knew about the fights nor do I remember us crying. We just
grew up together like that and you never went out with me, but I knew you
loved me more than anything.

The neighborhood knew about us, but noting much was said until the energy
we both felt about in the community when you became the person every one
asked when things went wrong at home, but that luxury of mine was momentary
and something I long for after forgetting about my whole life.

Love,

Michael
