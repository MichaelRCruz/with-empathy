Love is something I do not want to think about because I do not feel love from any one now and, by virtue of that fact, I did not feel love from any one before. Before I lived in the city of angels, I predicted that the love of my life lived in Los Angeles, but that is difficult for me to believe for any city today. When I said that, I was wishing her into reality because I was gaining years, well-educated, motivated, and willing to learn. I had insurance. I had a new car. I was an engineer. I am like the pilots and astronauts our parents romanticized. Why did all of you women abuse me the way you do? All of you lied to me, gave me fake names, cheated on me with my friends, cheated on me with other people in school so much that I began lusting after the women in the altered photographs on the Internet.
